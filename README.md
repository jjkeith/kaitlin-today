# kaitlin-today
A minimalist blog created with the narrow purpose of delivering a digestible quantity of news to one person &mdash; the titular Kaitlin &mdash; every day.

### Note: Masonry is in progress so the layout looks a little odd at the moment.

### Future Plans
* a form for adding new posts
* a calendar-based post browser
* tag sorting
* masonry/less rigid layout
