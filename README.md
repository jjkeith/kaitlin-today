# kaitlin-today
A minimalist blog created with the narrow purpose of delivering a digestible quantity of news to one person &mdash; the titular Kaitlin &mdash; every day. It is hand-coded and includes a pared-down flexbox-based grid system.

### Future Plans
* addition of angular or other templating framework
* spruce up medium views -- create a non-flipping card that has image and text side-by-side
* cleaned up and dry'ed out styles
* load management 
* add a CSS autoprefixer
