# kaitlin-today
A minimalist blog created with the narrow purpose of delivering a digestible quantity of news to one person &mdash; the titular Kaitlin &mdash; every day. It is hand-coded and includes a pared-down flexbox-based grid system.

### Future Plans
* addition of angular or other templating framework
* cleaned up and dry'ed out styles
* browsing by month
* CSS pre-processing (or at least cleaned up vendor prefixes)
