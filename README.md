# kaitlin-today
A minimalist blog created with the narrow purpose of delivering a digestible quantity of news to one person &mdash; the titular Kaitlin &mdash; every day. It is hand-coded and includes a pared-down flexbox-based grid system.

### Future Plans
* add angular or other templating framework
* spruce up medium views -- create a non-flipping card that has image and text side-by-side
* clean up and dry out styles
* load management/calendar range picker
* CSS autoprefixing
* Fade animation on subheads/decks
