                        But today he finally made his position clear: JK about condemning Nazis. Let's talk about the "alt-left"! What's next, taking down statues of George Washington because he owned slaves?

                        Heaps of politicians of all persuasions have found a way to more forcefully condemn the violence, but let's be honest: the chewy center of his support are white supremacists, and that he relies on their online vitriol to keep his enemies occupied and a little bit afraid.

                        Friday night a bunch of dudes in dad khakis, white polos and MAGA hats decided enough was enough and marched through UVA <i>armed with Tiki torches</i>, exhibiting pretty much every single negative stereotype about Americans at once.

                        ETA: As you surely know, the planning "gathering" of Nationalist Nazis was dispersed before it could even begin and then a domestic terrorist drove his car into a crowd of anti-Nazis and murdered a woman.

                        Yesterday we learned that Trump's "fire and fury" comments were fo' sure off the cuff and not made in consultation with the State Department or the Pentagon. That was pretty obvious already. <i>Maybe</i> though, some of those "adults in the room" got to him to put his rhetoric in check?
                        <br>
                        Nope! Trump said his remarks the other day weren't "tough enough."
