            <h4 class="container__subheader">I bought this domain to create an audience of one</h4>
            <p>This website could easily be replaced by a few well-deployed push notifications, and yet Kaitlin insists
                on remaining ignorant, immune to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Scaramucci"

            <p>But no more! Kaitlin can come here for her daily dose of news (or newsiness) and maybe... finally... admit that I am
                funny.</p>
            <h4 class="container__subheader">Democracy Dies in Kaitlin</h4>
            <p>Yeah, man. Sounds super serious, but there's a lot out there that bears witness, and Kaitlin's darkness
                if probably killing democracy.

            <h4 class="container__subheader">Why Does This Website Look Like It Was Created in 1999?</h4>
            <p>I was in a hurry because Kaitlin's busting out of town into an infinite abyss of newslessness.</p>
            <p>Also, it's more 2004, if we're being completely honest. Give me some credit.</p>

                    Microwaves fish at the office, but typically in an inoffensive way. Like, usually it's more of "Oh
                    dear, where did
                    that hot fish come from?" rather than, "WHO THE HELL MICROWAVED FISH?!

                    Does not understand why I would choose the phrasing "Democracy dies in Kaitlin." Like, it just
                    sounds weird to her and will someone <i>please</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com"

                North Korea is all, “We can hella nuke you,.” Sensible government officials are like, “Let’s find a way
                to deescalate.” Trump: “I TRIPLE DOG DARE YA, MOTHAFUCKAS.”
