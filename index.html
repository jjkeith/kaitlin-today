                        The United States' longest war continues. Trump has announced a modest increase increase of troops in Afghanistan because the U.S. has been losing ground to Al Qaeda over the last few years. This response is likely encouraged by his more hawkish advisers and contradicts his isolationist campaign rhetoric.

                        A lotta-lotta people are calling for Trump's impeachment &mdash; a few lawmakers have even already drawn up the articles. Others are saying that it's time to invoke the 25th Amendment and have Trump's Cabinet remove him. Senior Democratic leadership has been more cautious, including House Minority Leader, Rep. Adam Schiff.
                        <br>
                        That said, Rep. Schiff talked <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/08/20/schiff-questions-trumps-capability-says-issue-could-get-worse-with-time" target="_blank">hella shit</a> about Trump on CNN. He did not ask for his formal ouster, but he did suggest some staffing changes, notably the removal of Seb Gorka and "C+ Santa Monica Fascist" (&copy; Jon Lovett) Stephen Miller as solid candidates to be eliminated on next week's <i>Apprentice</i>.

                        Maggie Haberman, who breaks all the juiciest stories and is basically a superhero, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/us/politics/steve-bannon-trump-white-house.html" target="_blank">is reporting</a> that Bannon will no longer be chief strategist. It's unclear if Bannon quit first or if Trump is pushing him out.
                        <br>
                        This seemed inevitable as earlier this week, Bannon gave an interview to a progressive outlet in which he undermined Trump's warlord mentality on North Korea and dismissed white nationalists as "losers." <i class="em em-scream_cat"></i>

                        First Trump condemned the violence in Charlottesville "on many sides" &mdash; spreading the blame among the white supremacists and the counter protesters.
                        <br>
                        Then he was like, Naw, guys; I'm super against Nazis and that biz was not okay.
                        <br>
                        But today he finally made his position clear: JK about condemning Nazis. Let's talk about the "alt-left"! What's next, taking down statues of George Washington because he owned slaves?

                        Kenneth C. Frazier, CEO of Merck, quit the President's American Manufacturing Council in protest of Trump's "many sides" quote, "America’s leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal."

                        Trump, rather than do a normal politician thing like condemn the KKK, issued a statement that condemned the “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.”
                        <br>
                        Heaps of politicians of all persuasions have found a way to more forcefully condemn the violence, but let's be honest: the chewy center of his support are white supremacists, and that he relies on their online vitriol to keep his enemies occupied and a little bit afraid.

                        Friday night a bunch of dudes in dad khakis, white polos and MAGA hats decided enough was enough and marched through UVA <i>armed with Tiki torches</i>, exhibiting pretty much every single negative stereotype about Americans at once.

                        Today, the riot segment of the show began and it's about time that we accept that we are somehow relitigating the 1960s... in 2017.
                        <br>
                        ETA: As you surely know, the planning "gathering" of Nationalist Nazis was dispersed before it could begin and a domestic terrorist drove his car into a crowd of anti-Nazis and killed a woman.

                        <b>Trump</b>: We knew he holds grudges, but when Priebus was let go, we learned that part of it was that Trump never forgave him for not immediately standing by Trump after the whole "grab 'em by the <i class="em em-cat2"></i>" thing. Fun fact: you know who else paused (paws'ed? no? sorry.) after the <i class="em em-cat2"></i> thing? Pence.

                        Yesterday we learned that Trump's "fire and fury" comments were fo' sure off the cuff and not made in consultation with the State Department or the Pentagon. That was pretty obvious already. <i>Maybe</i> though, some of those "adults in the room" got to him to put his rhetoric in check?
                        <br>
                        Nope! Trump said his remarks the other day weren't "tough enough."
                        <br>
                        Kim Jung Un says he's thinking about sending some nukes Guam's way, but he's probably just showboating. Right? It's probably going to be alright. Right? Yeah. Maybe? Let's just go with <i class="em em-grimacing"></i>.

                        Paul Manafort is a super un-cool dude with ties not just to Russia, but to Turkey, which is the latest place where Democracy has driven its car off a cliff. <br>
                        Former CIA Director John Brennan said to the House Intelligence Committee, "People on a treasonous path ....don't always realize they're on that path until it's too late." It's hard to know yet if Manafort realized what he was doing or not.

                        North Korea is all, “We can hella nuke you.” Sensible government officials are like, “Let’s find a way to deescalate.” Trump: “I TRIPLE DOG DARE YA.”

                        So, it preeeettty much looks like Pence has plans for a promotion, or so says <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/06/us/politics/mike-pence-election-2020.html?_r=0" target="__blank"><i>The New York Times</i></a>. He totally swears that he doesn't have any such plans, but dude is knee-deep in Koch Brothers.
                        <br>
                        Because no one can just talk to Trump, Pence issued a statement directed solely at him saying that it was bogus and he's hella VP4Lyfe.
