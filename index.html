                    Let's ignore the Pyongyang drama for a day and instead talk about weird things we've learned about Trump and Kim Jung Un.
                    <br>
                    <b>Trump</b>: We knew he holds grudges, but when Priebus was let go, we learned that part of it was that Trump never forgave him for not immediately standing by Trump after the whole "grab 'em by the <i class="em em-cat2"></i>" thing. Fun fact: you know who else paused (paws'ed? no? sorry.) after the <i class="em em-cat2"></i> thing? Pence.
                    <br>
                    <b>Dear Leader</b>: He's got a thing about <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/06/22/even-kim-jong-uns-ears-get-photoshopped/" target="_blank">PhotoShopping his ears</a>.

                    Yesterday we learned that Trump's "fire and fury" comments were fo' sure off the cuff and not made in consultation with the State Department or the Pentagon. That was pretty obvious already. <i>Maybe</i> though, some of those "adults in the room" got to him to put his rhetoric in check?
                    <br>
                    Nope! Trump said his remarks the other day weren't "tough enough."
                    <br>
                    Kim Jung Un says he's thinking about sending some nukes Guam's way, but he's probably just showboating. Right? It's probably going to be alright. Right? Yeah. Maybe? Let's just go with <i class="em em-grimacing"></i>.

                    Paul Manafort is a super un-cool dude with ties not just to Russia, but to Turkey, which is the latest place where Democracy has driven its car off a cliff. <br>
                    Former CIA Director John Brennan said to the House Intelligence Committee, "People on a treasonous path ....don't always realize they're on that path until it's too late." It's hard to know yet if Manafort realized what he was doing or not.

                    North Korea is all, “We can hella nuke you.” Sensible government officials are like, “Let’s find a way to deescalate.” Trump: “I TRIPLE DOG DARE YA.”

                    So, it preeeettty much looks like Pence has plans for a promotion, or so says <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/06/us/politics/mike-pence-election-2020.html?_r=0" target="__blank"><i>The New York Times</i></a>. He totally swears that he doesn't have any such plans, but dude is knee-deep in Koch Brothers.
                    <br>
                    Because no one can just talk to Trump, Pence issued a statement directed solely at him saying that it was bogus and he's hella VP4Lyfe.
